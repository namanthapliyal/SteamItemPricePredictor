Steam-Price-Predictor
Copyright to Naman Thapliyal. A college project for final year. Steam Price predictor using ml. This is first version of the project. This project has a scrapper that do web scraping of nearly 30 items available on steam community market. Takes their price history dataset and stores it in a csv file. Then we use the data set to perform regression and predict the price of the item using linear regression.

Version 2

I have added one more model using same date varaiable as x value but this time using polynomial function.
Also shown why quantity sold can't be taken as an attribute for price prediction.
Created two prediction function one which predicts on linear model using date as x and price as y.
Other uses polynomial model using date as an attribute and price as y value.
